    <p>A long essay for class 3 is a bit more advanced as it involves balancing facts with a good narrative. Here is an example of an extended food essay:
      Food constitutes different types of stuff we eat that are sourced from plants and animals. 
      Humans are omnivores and consume a broad range of food items sourced from agricultural fields, forests, oceans, and farms. Food provides the energy to a person for proper physical and mental functioning, and every nutrient helps build and repair the body.
     The food we eat can be broadly categorised as fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy. These categories of foods contain all the nutrients the body needs. For example, grains are a source of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, while meats are a great source of protein and micronutrients. It is important to consume all the food categories as part of a balanced diet to maintain good health and growth.
     Carbohydrates in food give us the energy that is needed to perform everyday activities. Proteins are essential for the growth and repair of the body after injury or exercise. Fats are a dense source of energy and a medium for absorbing several fat-soluble nutrients. Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients needed for all kinds of cellular processes. It is believed that a good diet consists of high protein, fats, and a good amount of carbohydrates, while fruits and vegetables give vitamins and minerals.
     In todayâ€™s time, people consume plenty of fast food and junk food which consists of high sugar, high sodium, and trans fats, which are all unhealthy. Eating excess junk food makes people feel full and avoid eating other nutritious foods that the body requires. Eating junk food is harmful as it leads to obesity and other health problems in the long run.
     Ideally, people should eat healthy foods from a wide source and avoid junk altogether. But since fast food is part of our modern world, it can be consumed in low quantities but not at the expense of healthy foods.</p>
